Handles the full brainstorming and plan writing lifecycle.\n- /dp-cto:execute — execute a plan with Agent Teams (default) and optional worktree isolation. Requires a plan from /dp-cto:start.\n- /dp-cto:ralph — teammate-based autonomous loop with fresh context per iteration. Args: PROMPT [--max-iterations N] [--completion-promise TEXT] [--quality-gate CMD].\n- /dp-cto:ralph-cancel — cancel an active ralph loop.\n- /dp-cto:verify — manual deep-validation of research findings.\n\nThese are DISTINCT skills. /dp-cto:execute is NOT the same as executing-plans. Never substitute one dp-cto skill for another.\n\nWorkflow: /dp-cto:start → /dp-cto:execute.\n\nQuality skills from superpowers remain available and are invoked automatically by execute: test-driven-development, requesting-code-review, receiving-code-review, systematic-debugging, verification-before-completion, writing-skills, using-superpowers.\n\nStage enforcement is active. The hook tracks your workflow stage and only allows valid transitions:\nidle → start → planned → execute → executing → complete → start (new cycle)\nralph and verify are allowed during executing. ralph-cancel is always allowed.\nOut-of-order skill invocations will be denied by the hook.\n\nEnforcement: Attempts to use intercepted skills will be denied by the PreToolUse hook.\n</EXTREMELY_IMPORTANT>"
